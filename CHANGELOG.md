# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 2.0.0

### Added

  * Added the `--json-output` flag. This generates a JSON formatted document
    describing the QC results.

  * Each threshold file entry should include pass/fail messages. This is used
    to generate human readable output with more relevant information because
    the analyst can write the QC pass/fail messages themselves rather than the
    less readable machine-generated output. These pass/fail messages are
    available via the `message` key in the JSON output.

  * Each threshold file entry should include an `fail_code`. The failure codes
    are returned for the failing QC thresholds. These can then be used to make
    downstream QC decisions.

  * Each threshold file entry has an optional `tags` field. This can be used
    for adding analyst metadata to each entry, such as labelling the threshold
    types.

### Changed

  * The threshold file tests must now must all evaluate to TRUE for a pass.
    This contrasts with the 1.x version where all thresholds must evaluate to
    FALSE for a pass. This means the threshold file is now written as a series
    of statements describing how the sequence data should be to considered as
    passing QC.

  * Removed namespacing of analyses in the analysis file. The analysis file is
    now a dictionary with the fields `data` and `metadata`. The field `data` is
    a dictionary containing a the required metrics to do QC.

### Removed

  * The `--yaml-output` and `--text-output` flags are now no longer supported.
    Detailed information instead retrieved using the `--json-output` flag.
    Tools such as `jq` can then be used to formatted this into whatever
    human-readable format is desired.
